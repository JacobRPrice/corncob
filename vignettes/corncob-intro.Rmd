## Introduction

When studying dysbiosis, the focus is often on identifying differentially abundant taxa. However, microbial imbalance can also affect the stability of taxa. Here, we introduce \texttt{corncob}, an individual taxon regression model that uses abundance tables and sample data. \texttt{corncob} is able to identify differentially abundant taxa and differentially variable taxa. In addition, it is able to compare microbiomes using continuous covariates (not just group assignment covariates). \texttt{corncob} is appropriate for both rare and common taxa, excessive zeros, overdispersion, and inconsistent sequencing depths.
