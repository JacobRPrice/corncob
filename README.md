## Installation

To download the corncob package, use the code below.

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bryandmartin/corncob")
library(corncob)
```

## Use

There is currently a vignette that shows examples of all major corncob functions. Please [file an issue](https://github.com/bryandmartin/corncob/issues) if you have a request for a tutorial that is not currently included. You can see the vignette by using the following code:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bryandmartin/corncob", build = TRUE)
library(corncob)
# Use this to view the vignette in the corncob HTML help
help(package = "corncob", help_type = "html")
# Use this to view the vignette as an isolated HTML file
utils::browseVignettes(package = "corncob")
```

Note that R does not allow variable names to start with numbers. Sometimes, when going directly from QIIME2 to phyloseq objects, taxa names will be a large string starting with numbers. To clean these taxa names for use with corncob, use  `clean_taxa_names(my_phyloseq_object)`, see `?clean_taxa_names` for details.

## Status

The preprint describing the corncob methodology is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02776).
